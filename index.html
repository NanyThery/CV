  <p> Passionate about communication, and innovation within the online environment. Nowadays, it is all about seducing the customer through a useful and meaningful content. But also identifing who is your customer, and how are you the right provider
    for her.
    Along my career, I have developed several positions that allowed me to be in direct contact with the customer. Understanding her needs enough to know that the purchase motivations and fears are constant. Whilst the ways and the channels are
    constantly changing.
    I am an expert in testing processes, questioning statements, and not giving anything for granted. Moved and guided by empathy and motivation.
    I feel comfortable and motivated in international and cosmopolitan environments. I am always willing to travel, bringing the brand with me. My goal is to inspire my teams and to create great working environtments to develop professionaly all the
    persons involved.</td>
